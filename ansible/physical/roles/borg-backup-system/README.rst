borg-backup-system
==================

Configure system-wide backups with `Borg`_.

More specifically, do the following:

1. Install borg.
2. Create a system user that will perform backups, and ensure this user belongs
   to the "root" group.
3. Install ``~/.ssh/borg-backup`` and ``~/.ssh/config`` for this user.
4. Install a system-wide script to perform backups, and ensure only the backup
   user can run it.
5. Install, start and enable system-wide units to periodically call the backup
   script.

The Borg repositories on the remote backup host are distinguished by host names.
As a result, multiple hosts may back up to the same remote backup host.

Example playbook:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - hosts: borg-backup-system-hosts
      roles:
      - borg-backup-system

Example variables file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    borg_backup_system_local_paths:
    - /var/local/subsonic/backups

Example private variables file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    borg_backup_system_passphrase: pass
    borg_backup_system_private_key: /path/to/key

Variables:

``borg_backup_system_local_paths``
    Required. A list of paths to back up. These paths are subject to Bash's
