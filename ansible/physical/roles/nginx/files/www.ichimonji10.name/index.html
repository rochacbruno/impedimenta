    You can get an OK understanding of my skill set by checking out my <a
    href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyaudet'>LinkedIn</a> and <a
    href='https://github.com/Ichimonji10'>GitHub</a> profiles. The abridged
    version is this: I know about software engineering, Linux system
    administration, computer networking and computer engineering, in that order.
    You can get in touch via <a href="mailto:jerebear@protonmail.com">email</a>.

    Outside of work, I like to geek out over computer projects, engage in
    non-team sports such as lifting and biking, consume a steady diet of books
    and podcasts, and spend time with friends and family. I'm modestly engaged
    with the Arch Linux community: I <a

    >maintain packages</a>, <a
    href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Special:Contributions/Ichimonji10'
    >edit the wiki</a> and participate in mailing lists, among other things.
