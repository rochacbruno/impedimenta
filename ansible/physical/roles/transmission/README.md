transmission
============

Install, configure, start and enable Transmission bittorrent client.

When executed, this role will do the following:

1. Install transmission.
2. Install a script that Transmission executes when it starts up. This script
   does the following:

   1. Wait for a VPN tunnel to become available and be initialized with an IPv4
      address.
   2. If Transmission doesn't have a configuration file, create one. Otherwise,
      set several parameters in it. These parameters include the tunnel IP
      address and speed limits.

3. Install an override file for transmission.service. This override file ensures
   that a tunnel is available when transmission.service is running, and it
   ensures that the aforementioned script executes before transmission.service
   starts.
4. Start and enable Transmission.

Variables:

* `transmission_password`: Optional. A password that users must provde to
  Transmission to view its web interface. If provided, the Transmission
  configuration script is installed.
